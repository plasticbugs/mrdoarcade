# Mr. Do Arcade ColecoVision Rom Hack

This work is based on the original Mr. Do game for the ColecoVision and was made possible by the disassembly work done by Captain Cosmos on the Atari Age forums.

Changes:
- Arcade Title screen
- Redesigned sprites (created by TIX@AtariAge)
- Full screen image intermission for Extra Mr. Do
- Full screen "Very Good" intermission with music every 3rd, 6th and 9th rounds
- Extra Mr. Do tune (Astro Boy theme song)
- Main background music (the Can Can song)
- Lose a life jingle
- End of round jingle
- "Extra" letter mode/chomper jingle
- Screen stays red for "Extra" alphamonster/chomper mode
- Updated collision detection so Mr. Do doesn't get stuck after intersecting an apple from above or below!
 - Fix final two notes in the "game over" tune
- Two-color Mr. Do sprite with four frames of animation
- Updated phase colors/patterns to match arcade levels
- Ball cool down removed during alpha monster mode.
- Move to screen 2 the game to have high res colors for the playfiled

Wish list/To do list:
- Icon marker for "how" level was completed on "Very Good" screen
- Wonderful screen every 10th level that shows average score per level and average time to complete each level along with score and time data for the previous level.
